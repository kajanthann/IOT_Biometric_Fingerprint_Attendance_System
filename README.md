# 📌 ESP32 Fingerprint Attendance System

This project is an **IoT-based Attendance Management System** built using **ESP32**, **AS608 Fingerprint Sensor**, **Adafruit OLED Display**, and **Firebase Realtime Database**.  
It allows students to **enroll fingerprints** and later verify them for **attendance logging**. Data is stored in Firebase with timestamps for tracking.
